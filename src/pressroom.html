										<h5 class="-font-alt -margin-half">The Guardian - 07/11/2017</h5>
										<p>It&rsquo;s one of the last remaining modes of transport that has been relatively untouched by innovation. The UK rail sector transports 1.5 billion passengers annually and benefits from billions of pounds of investment, but has struggled to move with the times. That could be about to change. Last month Virgin Trains East Coast signed a deal with startup Seatfrog, an app that auctions seat upgrades two hours before travel.</p>

										<p>First class upgrades when travelling by train are notoriously expensive, especially when you buy them on the day. As someone who frequently travels, and frequently sees dozens and dozens of plush first class seats available while I'm sandwiched in standard class like I'm being shipped to some kind of cattle market, it's more than just a bit frustrating.</p>
