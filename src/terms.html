                            <h2>Seatfrog Terms of Service</h2>
                            <p>Last update: 24 May 2018</p>
                            <p>Please read these Terms of Service (<strong>Terms</strong>) carefully before using the Seatfrog App (<strong>App</strong>) or the website at <a href="http://www.seatfrog.com" target="_blank">http://www.seatfrog.com</a> (<strong>Website</strong>). The App and the Website each provide a platform allowing certain products and services (<strong>Products</strong>) provided by third party travel companies (<strong>Carriers</strong>) to be offered for sale to our Users (as defined below) (<strong>Seatfrog Services</strong>).</p>
                            <p>The Website and the App, are operated by, and the Seatfrog Services are provided by, Seatfrog Ops Ltd a company incorporated in England (Company number <strong>10784220</strong> ) of 11 Staple Inn, WC1V 7QH, United Kingdom (referred to as "<strong>we</strong>", "<strong>us</strong>" or "<strong>our</strong>").</p>
                            <h4 class="-margin-none">1. ACCEPTANCE OF TERMS</h4>
                            <p>Your access to and use of the Seatfrog Services is conditional on your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. These Terms apply to all users of the Seatfrog Services (<strong>Users</strong>).</p>
                            <p>Upon electronic acceptance of these Terms, you are bound by these Terms and these Terms form an agreement between us and you (<strong>Agreement</strong>).</p>
                            <p><strong>Seatfrog is not acting as agent for any User. The Seatfrog Services are intended to facilitate transactions between Users and Carriers. Seatfrog does not owe or accept any fiduciary or other responsibility to Users other than as expressly set out in these Terms or as otherwise implied by operation of applicable law.  Seatfrog will act as agent for Carriers in relation to any sales of Products to Users by Carriers via the Website and/or the App. Seatfrog may earn commission from Carriers upon the sale of Products as detailed in these Terms.</strong></p>
                            <h4 class="-margin-none">2. MODIFICATION</h4>
                            <p>We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time in accordance with this provision. If we modify these Terms, we will post the revised Terms on the App and Website and update the “Last Updated” date at the top of these Terms.</p>
                            <p>We will also provide you with notice of the modifications by email and inform you of your right to terminate the Agreement in the notification email. If you disagree with the revised Terms, you may terminate this Agreement with immediate effect. If you do not terminate the Agreement after the revised Terms have been posted on the App and Website and you continue to access and use the Seatfrog Services, such continued access or use will constitute acceptance of the revised Terms.</p>
                            <p>Notwithstanding the above, if these Terms are modified while you have an active bid, the modifications will not apply to that active bid and the Terms in effect when that bid was placed will apply to that bid.</p>
                            <h4 class="-margin-none">3. ELIGIBILITY</h4>
                            <p>The Seatfrog Services are intended solely for persons who are 18 years or older. Any access to or use of the Seatfrog Services by anyone under 18 years is expressly prohibited. By accessing or using the Seatfrog Services you represent and warrant that you are 18 years or older.</p>
                            <h4 class="-margin-none">4. HOW THE SEATFROG SERVICES WORK</h4>
                            <p>The Seatfrog Services facilitate Users bidding for and/or purchasing Products offered for sale (whether by auction or otherwise) by Carriers. For example, a User can use the Seatfrog Services to bid to obtain from a Carrier, an upgrade to a premium cabin for an airline trip or purchase an upgrade to a higher class of travel for a train trip.</p>
                            <p>Products offered for sale via the Website and/or the App are offered for sale by Carriers and not by Seatfrog. Carriers are responsible for setting all auction and purchase parameters such as auction duration, opening and closing times, reserve price, “Upgrade Now” options and all other terms and conditions of purchase of Products. Seatfrog is authorised to receive and accept bids for Products for and on behalf of Carriers as agent for Carriers, and bids will be received and accepted in accordance with the terms and conditions of purchase of Products set by the Carriers.</p>
                            <p>We may also issue, on behalf of Carriers, an electronic ticket to Users for any Products that they purchase.</p>
                            <p>You may participate in auctions and/or bid for Products by entering your booking reference number into the App or Website. If you are an eligible passenger and Products in respect of your trip are available via the App or Website, you may be able to enter a bid for a Product or where possible, purchase a Product outright.</p>
                            <p>Bids placed by Users for Products available for sale are irrevocable and cannot be modified once placed. Users who purchase a Product from a Carrier are subject to the same terms and conditions which would have applied to that Product had it been purchased otherwise than via the Website or the App, and by any subsequent changes to those terms and conditions. Any additional terms and conditions that a Carrier applies to a Product before it is offered for sale to you, will be notified to you before you place a bid for that Product.</p>
                            <h4 class="-margin-none">5. ACCESSING THE SERVICES</h4>
                            <p>We reserve the right to:</p>

                            <p>You acknowledge that we have the right (but not the obligation) to monitor your access to or use of, or any other User’s access to or use of, the Seatfrog Services, for the following purposes: </p>

                            </ul>
                            <h4 class="-margin-none">6. SEATFROG APP</h4>
                            <p>We reserve the right to make changes to the App at any time. Currently the App is available on iOS and Android, and you may need to download updates to the App to continue using it.</p>
                            <p>Certain functionality within the App, such as adding a trip and placing a bid, requires an active internet connection.</p>
                            <p>Using the App without Wi-Fi may result in charges from your mobile provider for the cost of data during the duration of the connection when using the App, and other third party charges. By using the App, you accept responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data charges if you are using the App outside of your home territory. If you are not the bill payer for the device that you are using the App on, we are entitled to assume that you have permission from the bill payer to use the App.</p>
                            <p>We reserve the right to stop providing the App, and may terminate use of it at any time and without prior notice to you. Unless otherwise advised, upon termination:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>the rights and licenses granted to you in these Terms terminate immediately;</li>
                                <li>you must stop using the App; and</li>
                                <li>if instructed, delete the App from your device(s).</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h4 class="-margin-none">8. YOUR ACCOUNT</h4>
                            <p>Your Account is created based upon the information you provide to us and you warrant that all information you provide to us is true, accurate and complete and you undertake to promptly update your information if it ceases to be true, accurate and complete.</p>

                            <p>If you discover or suspect a breach of any of the above, you must inform us immediately.</p>
                            <h4 class="-margin-none">9. PAYMENTS</h4>
                            <p>Each Carrier may pay Seatfrog a commission upon the sale of a Product. The amount of that commission is confidential as between Seatfrog and the respective Carrier paying it.</p>
                            <p>The price for each Product (<strong>Price</strong>) is inclusive of applicable taxes and all other charges, including the commission we receive from the Carrier on the sale of its Product.</p>
                            <p>We currently accept payments made using the following debit and credit cards (subject to verification by our third party payment company, Braintree):</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>MasterCard; and</li>
                                <li>Visa.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>You acknowledge and agree that:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>payment of the Price must be made to Seatfrog and not to the Carrier (who has authorised Seatfrog to collect the Price on its behalf);</li>
                                <li>payment of the Price will be taken automatically:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>during the auction should your bid exceed the reserve price for an outright Product sale;</li>
                                        <li>at auction close should you hold the winning bid; or</li>
                                        <li>when you have completed the checkout process for a Product which can be purchased outright,</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    from the credit card associated with your Seatfrog Account and selected as the “Default Card”;
                                </li>
                                <li>in the case of payment failure, you may be presented with an opportunity to process your payment by choosing another card or entering new credit cards details;</li>
                                <li>we may, from time to time, undertake authorisation checks on your nominated payment methods; and</li>
                                <li>we act in a limited capacity as agent for the Carrier in relation to the payment by you of the Price.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>If you wish to dispute the Price or a particular transaction for a Product, please contact us at <a href="mailto:help@seatfrog.com" target="_blank">help@seatfrog.com</a>.</p>
                            <p>You agree to co-operate with us in the resolution of your dispute.</p>
                            <h4 class="-margin-none">10. CURRENCY CONVERSION</h4>
                            <p>Seatfrog facilitates transactions between Users and Carriers where a User may pay for a Product in a currency different from the Carrier’s stipulated currency of sale for the Product.</p>
                            <p>The App and the Website allows Users to view, bid and purchase Products in a number of currencies, with currency exchange rates set on a daily basis.</p>
                            <p>You may place bids or make payments in various currencies by changing your settings. We will calculate the amount payable in the currency that you select using the then current conversion rate obtained from one or more third parties such as OFX (<a href="https://www.ofx.com" target="_blank">https://www.ofx.com</a>). We will apply a mark up of up to 5% the conversion rate, which in part covers our risk of currency fluctuations. We will notify you if we change any of these arrangements. Your purchase is made at the time the Price is paid and no supplement will be charged (or refund given) if there is a change in the exchange rate between the time of purchase and the date of travel. You may change the payment currency at any time by changing the preferences in your settings, found in the menu within the App.</p>
                            <h4 class="-margin-none">11. CARRIER LOYALTY PROGRAMS</h4>
                            <p>The earning and redemption of loyalty points, miles or status credits from Carriers is subject to the terms and conditions of the applicable loyalty programs operated by Carriers. Unless otherwise stated, Users who are members of a Carrier’s loyalty program will not be eligible to earn, redeem or set-off against the Price any loyalty points, miles or status credits when purchasing a Product via the Website or the App.</p>
                            <h4 class="-margin-none">12. PROMOTIONAL CODES</h4>
                            <p>We may, in our sole discretion, generate promotional codes (<strong>Promo Codes</strong>) from time to time, which may be redeemable by you through your Account via the Website and the App, subject to any additional terms which we establish on a per Promo Code basis (<strong>Promo Terms</strong>). </p>
                            <p>You agree that, unless expressly stated otherwise, Promo Codes:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>are to be used by you only;</li>
                                <li>may only be used pursuant to the Promo Terms;</li>
                                <li>may not be duplicated, sold or transferred to any third party;</li>
                                <li>must not be made available to the general public;</li>
                                <li>may be disabled by us at any time for any reason;</li>
                                <li>may not be exchanged for cash or any other benefit in kind; and</li>
                                <li>may expire prior to redemption.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <h4 class="-margin-none">13. REFUNDS AND COMPLAINTS</h4>
                            <p><strong>You acknowledge and agree that each Carrier is solely responsible for, and Seatfrog will have no responsibility or liability whatsoever to you or any other person for, the delivery, quality or standard of the Product provided by any Carrier.</strong></p>
                            <p>If you are not satisfied with a Product provided by a Carrier, please:</p>
                            <ul>
